# 👋 Hi everybody! I’m @elbCHEM
- 📚 I am a PhD student at the Department of Chemistry, UCPH.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computational High-Entropy Alloys Catalysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about catalysis of long-chain hydrocarbon products.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my team at CHEAC as well as my partners at CAPeX.  
- 💬 I speak Danish 🇩🇰 and English 🇬🇧.
- 📪 You can reach me at elb@chem.ku.dk. 
- 💻 I mainly use Python 🐍, but also have experience with Cython, MATLAB, and C++.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am extremely good at finding four-leaf clovers 🍀. It is a very useless, but fun party-trick.
